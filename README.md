# SuperPy

Command-Line Interface (CLI):
The implementation utilizes a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the inventory management system. 
The argparse module is used to define and parse command-line arguments, 
enabling users to perform actions such as buying/selling products, 
generating reports, and exporting data. The CLI provides a user-friendly and efficient way to interact with the system, 
allowing users to execute commands and provide necessary input parameters easily.

CSV File:
The inventory and sales data are stored in CSV files using the csv module for reading and writing operations. 
The implementation provides functions to read and write CSV files, allowing seamless storage and retrieval of data. 
This approach offers a structured way to manage product information and sales records. 
It enables easy data manipulation, searching, and reporting capabilities.

Reporting and Visualization:
The system provides functionality to generate inventory, revenue, and profit reports based on specified date ranges. 
Additionally, it allows users to export reports to CSV files. To enhance data analysis and visualization, 
the implementation includes the option to visualize revenue statistics using matplotlib. 
This feature enables users to gain insights into revenue trends over time. 
By combining reporting and visualization, users can make decisions and monitor the performance of their inventory.

These elements address key aspects of an inventory management system. 
The CLI provides an accessible interface for users to interact with the system, 
facilitating data entry and retrieval. The CSV file handling ensures reliable storage and 
retrieval of inventory and sales data, allowing seamless data management and reporting. 
The reporting and visualization features enhance decision-making and provide valuable insights into 
inventory performance and financial aspects. Together, these elements contribute to an effective and 
user-friendly inventory management.
